## üìã Requirements

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- WebRTC support for camera access
- IndexedDB support
- WebAssembly support (for face-api.js)

### Recommended Browsers
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

### Hardware Requirements
- Camera (webcam or built-in)
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Modern CPU (for face processing)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Download Face-API Models
First, download the required face-api.js models:

\`\`\`bash
# Create models directory
mkdir models

# Download models (you'll need to get these from face-api.js repository)
# Place these files in the models directory:
# - ssd_mobilenetv1_model-weights_manifest.json
# - ssd_mobilenetv1_model-shard1
# - face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
# - face_landmark_68_model-shard1
# - face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
# - face_recognition_model-shard1
# - face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
# - face_expression_model-shard1
\`\`\`

### 2. Setup Web Server
The system requires a web server due to CORS restrictions:

\`\`\`bash
# Using Python (if available)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if available)
npx http-server -p 8000

# Using PHP (if available)
php -S localhost:8000
\`\`\`

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
\`\`\`
http://localhost:8000
\`\`\`

## üéØ Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **System Initialization**: Click "Initialize System" to start the face recognition engine
2. **Camera Permission**: Grant camera access when prompted
3. **Model Loading**: Wait for face recognition models to load (first time only)

### User Enrollment
1. Switch to "Enrollment" tab
2. Fill in user information (name, email, department)
3. Click "Start Enrollment" to begin face capture
4. Position face in the center guide and capture 5 high-quality samples
5. Click "Complete Enrollment" to save the user

### Attendance Marking
1. Switch to "Attendance" tab
2. Click "Initialize System" if not already active
3. Position face in front of camera
4. Click "Mark Attendance" when face is detected
5. System will recognize and log attendance automatically

### User Management
1. Switch to "Management" tab
2. View all enrolled users in the table
3. Search and filter users by department
4. Edit or delete users as needed
5. Export attendance data

## üîß Configuration

### Recognition Settings
You can adjust recognition parameters in `face-recognition.js`:

\`\`\`javascript
// Recognition threshold (0.0 - 1.0, lower = more strict)
this.recognitionThreshold = 0.6

// Quality threshold for enrollment (0.0 - 1.0)
this.qualityThreshold = 0.7
\`\`\`

### Performance Settings
Adjust detection frequency in `attendance-system.js`:

\`\`\`javascript
// Detection interval (milliseconds)
this.detectionInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  // Detection logic
}, 100) // 10 FPS
\`\`\`

## üß™ Testing

### Run System Tests
Open browser console and run:

\`\`\`javascript
// Run comprehensive system tests
runSystemTests()

// Check system health
checkSystemHealth()

// Export validation report
exportValidationReport()

// Toggle performance indicator
togglePerformanceIndicator()
\`\`\`

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Camera initialization works
- [ ] Face detection is accurate
- [ ] User enrollment completes successfully
- [ ] Face recognition works with enrolled users
- [ ] Attendance logging is accurate
- [ ] Data export functions properly
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully

## üìä Monitoring

### System Health
The system includes comprehensive health monitoring:

- **Database Health**: Response times and data integrity
- **Face Engine Health**: Model loading and recognition accuracy
- **Camera Health**: Device access and permissions
- **UI Health**: Component availability and functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage and response times

### Performance Indicators
Enable performance monitoring:

\`\`\`javascript
// Show performance indicator
togglePerformanceIndicator()

// Get system diagnostics
getSystemDiagnostics()
\`\`\`

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All data stored locally in browser's IndexedDB
- No data transmitted to external servers
- Camera access only during active sessions
- Face descriptors are encrypted mathematical representations

### Production Deployment
For production deployment:

1. **HTTPS Required**: Deploy over HTTPS for camera access
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers
3. **Access Control**: Add authentication and authorization
4. **Data Backup**: Implement regular data backup procedures
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost
- Verify camera is not in use by other applications

#### Face Recognition Not Working
- Ensure models are downloaded and accessible
- Check browser console for loading errors
- Verify face is well-lit and clearly visible

#### Performance Issues
- Check memory usage in performance indicator
- Reduce detection frequency if needed
- Clear browser cache and restart

#### Database Errors
- Check browser console for IndexedDB errors
- Clear browser data if corrupted
- Ensure sufficient storage space

### Debug Commands
\`\`\`javascript
// Check system status
app.getSystemStatus()

// View system logs
db.getSystemLogs({ limit: 50 })

// Clear all data (use with caution)
db.clearAllData()

// Export system data
exportData()
\`\`\`

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Best Practices
1. **Optimal Lighting**: Ensure good lighting for face detection
2. **Camera Position**: Position camera at eye level
3. **Face Size**: Maintain appropriate distance from camera
4. **System Resources**: Close unnecessary browser tabs
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Clear old logs and data periodically

### Monitoring Metrics
- Memory usage should stay below 100MB
- Database queries should complete under 100ms
- Face detection should run at 10+ FPS
- Recognition confidence should be above 60%
